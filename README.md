Overview:
This project employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to discern between images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. It's an engaging exploration into machine learning, utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook for seamless interaction.

Prerequisites:
Ensure Python (version >= 3.0) and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your system.

Installation:
Navigate to the project directory.
Install required packages using: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

Download the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset.
Organize the dataset into 'train' and 'test' folders.
Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook svm_image_classifier.ipynb
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to train the SVM model and make predictions.

Files:
svm_image_classifier.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the SVM implementation.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
